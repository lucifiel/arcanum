“But that wasn’t my fault!” she remonstrated. “I wasn’t even alive then - neither was my father, or his father’s father either!”

“It’s of no consequence to me,” returned Jora.
“I do not die Trill, and there are few things in this world that could do the trick.
So I have little interest in counting out the motes of dust you take for a lineage,
and piling them up like shivering dunes of sand,
to be scattered away with the faintest breeze.
A hundred of your generations are but a passing day to me,
and now you come, asking to be forgiven at evening for the mistakes you made this very afternoon.”
