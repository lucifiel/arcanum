So I have little interest in counting out the motes of dust you take for a lineage,
and piling them up like shivering dunes of sand,
to be scattered away with the faintest breeze.
A hundred of your generations are but a passing day to me,
and now you come, asking to be forgiven at evening for the mistakes you made this very afternoon.”
