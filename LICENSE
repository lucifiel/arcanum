I do not claim ownership of data contributions in the form of JSON files from individual users, but if you submit JSON to the project,
you are granting me permission to distribute these JSON files wherever I distribute the game -- otherwise, why send them to me? D:

The rest may become open source at some point, but I haven't decided what to do with it.

Hopefully some part of that holds some form of legal standing in some country or other. kek
